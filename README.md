Cookbook
=============

This began as a simple app to teach me Ember. I learned that I don't like Ember.

Now this is a simple app, to teach me how to build an effective UI and figure out what backend actually works!

NOTES:
-----

- Needs to support recipe images
- Recipe directions are missing the ingredients and measurements
- the renderElements function runs getHashName twice, which is redundant
- change "avail" items and lists to "selected" items
- change "unavail" items and lists to "filtered" items
